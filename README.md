# Do not use

This repository exists only because crates.io doesn't support `git` dependencies.

# Original readme

This Library allows using [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) with [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum). 
It authenticates the user with the OpenID Connect Issuer and provides Extractors.

# Usage
The `OidcAuthLayer` must be loaded on any handler that might use the extractors.
The user won't be automatically logged in using this layer.
If a valid session is found, the extractors will return the correct value and fail otherwise.

The `OidcLoginLayer` should be loaded on any handler on which the user is supposed to be authenticated.
The User will be redirected to the OpenId Conect Issuer to authenticate.
The extractors will always return a value.

The `OidcClaims`-extractor can be used to get the OpenId Conenct Claims.
The `OidcAccessToken`-extractor can be used to get the OpenId Connect Access Token.

The `OidcRpInitializedLogout`-extractor can be used to get the rp initialized logout uri.

Your OIDC-Client must be allowed to redirect to **every** subpath of your application base url.
